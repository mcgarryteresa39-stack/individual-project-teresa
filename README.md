## **About the Project**
This project analyzes poverty and inequality trends in the United Kingdom between 1967 and 2017 using data from the World Bank’s Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP). It explores changes in poverty headcount ratios across multiple international poverty lines ($2.15, $3.65, and $6.85 per day), with a particular focus on the upper-middle income threshold, which offers the most relevant benchmark for high-income countries like the UK. By examining long-term shifts in poverty prevalence, income gaps, and inequality indicators, the project highlights how economic restructuring, welfare reforms, and policy choices have shaped deprivation over five decades. The analysis situates UK poverty within a global context and provides a foundation for comparative and policy-relevant insights.

**Data Source**
The World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP) Dataset:

**The PIP Dataset Explained**
The PIP dataset provides harmonized poverty and inequality measures across countries and time. Using it ensures that UK trends can be benchmarked against:
- International income standards: $2.15/day, poverty lines
- Lower middle income: $3.65/day, poverty lines
- Upper-middle income: $6.85/day poverty lines).

The dataset provides consistent time-series data (1967 – present) allowing tracking of decades of poverty dynamics

For the UK this is especially important since extreme poverty (international line) is rare, but relative poverty remains an issue

In a high-income country like the UK, the upper-middle income poverty line ($6.85/day) is the most appropriate one to review

## **Understanding the PIP Dataset**
The World Bank’s PIP dataset contains two harmonized poverty series, one based on 2011 PPP and one on 2017 PPP. 
Both use the same international poverty lines ($2.15, $3.65, and $6.85/day), but the conversion factors differ.  
The 2017 PPP series provides the most up-to-date global comparability. 
Thus for this project, the 2017 PPP series is used as the reference, as it reflects the latest international calibration.
