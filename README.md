## **About the Project**
This project analyzes poverty and inequality trends in the United Kingdom between 1969 and 2017 using data from the **World Bank’s Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP)**. It explores changes in poverty ratios across multiple international poverty lines ($2.15, $3.65, and $6.85 per day), with a particular focus on the upper-middle income threshold, which offers the most relevant benchmark for high-income countries like the UK.

##**Data Source**
The World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP) Dataset:

###**The PIP Dataset and Assocaitd Resources Explained**

##**The PIP Dataset**
The PIP dataset provides harmonized poverty and inequality measures across countries and time. Using it ensures that UK trends can be benchmarked against:
- International income standards: $2.15/day, poverty lines
- Lower middle income: $3.65/day, poverty lines
- Upper-middle income: $6.85/day poverty lines.

The dataset provides consistent time-series data (1969 – 2017) allowing tracking of decades of poverty dynamics

For the UK this is especially important since extreme poverty (international line) is rare, but relative poverty remains an issue, as identified by this dataset.

In a high-income country like the UK, the upper-middle income poverty line ($6.85/day) is the most appropriate one to use for review.  

The World Bank’s PIP dataset contains two harmonized poverty series, one based on 2011 PPP and one on 2017 PPP. Both use the same international poverty lines ($2.15, $3.65, and $6.85/day), but the conversion factors differ.  The 2017 PPP series provides the most up-to-date global comparability. Thus for this project, the 2017 PPP series is used as the reference, as it reflects the latest international calibration.

## **PIP Codebook**
A list of all variables/features included in the datafile are available in the PIP codebook. The variables/features fall into 2 classifications: **Poverty** and **Inequality**.
The key ones for this project are:
**Poverty**
- **Mean**: The mean level of income or expenditure per day.
- **Median**The level of income or expenditure per day below which half of the population live.
- **Gini Index**: A measure of income or wealth inequality within a population. It tells you how evenly income or consumption is distributed across the entire income distribution.
- **Palma Index/Ratio**A measure of income inequality that compares the richest 10% to the poorest 40% of a population. It was developed as an alternative to the Gini coefficient, aiming to better capture disparities at the extremes of the income distribution.
- **Polarization**: 

- **MLD(Mean Log Derivation)**
- **Income Gap Ratio**
- **Average Income Shortfall**
- **Headcount ratio**
- **Poverty Gap Index**
